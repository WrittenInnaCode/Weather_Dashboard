# Weather Dashboard


## Description
This is a weather dashboard that runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS. Using the OpenWeather One Call API, the weather is retrieved for a searched city.


## Features
When the user opens the weather dashboard, they can search for a city in the input form. Then, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history. When the user views current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index. The UV index shows color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe. Also, the user is presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity. When the user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.
